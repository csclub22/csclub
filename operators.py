# operators (python) - by Julian
# note - no bitwise

# arithmetic operators
n = 1+2   # addition
n = 1-2   # subtraction
n = 1*2   # multiplication
n = 1/2   # division
n = 1%2   # modulus
n = 1**2  # exponentation
n = 1//2  # floor division

# assignment operators
n = 5     # equals
n += 5    # adds 5
n -= 5    # subtracts 5
n *= 5    # multiplies by 5
n /= 5    # divides by 5
n %= 5    # is equal to n%5
n //= 5   # is equeal to n floor division 5
n **= 5   # is equal to n to the power of 54

# comparason operators
if n == 11: pass                  # returns true if n = 11
if n != 11 : pass                 # returns true if n is not 11
if n > 11: pass                   # returns true if n is greater than 11
if n < 11: pass                   # returns true if n is smaller than 11
if n >= 11: pass                  # returns true if n is greater than or equal to 11
if n <= 11: pass                  # returns true if n is smaller than or equal to 11

# logical operators
if n == 11 and n == 10+1: pass    # returns true if both left and right return true
if n == 11 and n == 10: pass      # returns true if one of the results return true
if not(n == 1 and n == 10): pass  # returns true if both are false

# identity operators
if n is 11: pass                  # returns true if n is 11
if n is not 11: pass              # returns true if n is not 11

#membership operators
if n in "no": pass                # returns true if n is in "no"
if n not in "yes": pass           # returns true if n is not in "yes"
